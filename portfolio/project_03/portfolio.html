                    It is time to redefine the citizen’s role in our global efforts to create dynamic, human-centered and inclusive urban environments. How can these systemic design principles be informed by an innovative use of big data analytics tools for the creation of innovative urban policies and initiatives? From the energy perspective, we believe there is much to do and improve. Because the sun shines for free and we believe that energy should be a basic right for everyone.

                    Energy as a right is a proposal that try to rethink the energy system of Barcelona. It was developed taking the role of a local private community. Pursuing the dream of providing basic free energy for all residents of the city. Because the sun shines for free and we believe that energy should be a basic right for everyone. However, we know that is difficult to define how much should be free. From our perspective, enough to cover our basic needs: cooking, hot water and heating. It should be around 1000 kWh/year per person.

                    In order to develop a cohesive strategy to achieve a universal basic energy income, an extensive data collection and analysis process was carried out. In the process, the MaCT researchers came across a number of challenges and hurdles to overcome in order to achieve their objectives.

                    On top of these challenges, it is important to also have a view of the future of energy in 30 years. The Energy Transition Plan for Catalonia for 2050 indicates that the Catalan government is trying to move from a fossil-fuel-based energy system, dominated by five main companies at almost every step of the process, toward a greener and more distributed system. After this transition, 80% of the energy produced is expected to come from renewable sources, some of them public. Innovation will lead to a 40% reduction in our current energy consumption and a 75% reduction of our CO2 emissions.

                    We know we will have cleaner energy, but we want to go further than that. As a private community, we are outside the big energy market, only accessible for a production of over 100 kW – beyond the scale of our buildings, and the small market, getting just a partial discount in our energy, producing our own energy and selling our excess. If we want to reduce our energy consumption, we will need access to public subsidies to renovate our building. This is a complex process, however, only accessible after paying for the entire renovation project in advance.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>So, what can we do as a private community?</b>On one side we decide to join the forces of the communities to have the advantages of the big scale and on the other hand align ourselves with the administration in order to have free energy. We want to propose a deal to the city council of barcelona through a rights and duties agreement. We commit ourselves to take care of the energy renovation of our buildings and in exchange they provide us with free energy.

                    With the help of the government, we can raise financing and carry out the construction to achieve energy savings. The return on investment is achieved through reductions in consumption and the sale of un-emitted CO2 to the market. At the same time, we assume that the money from the EU Green Deal will go towards the development of a new public distributed green electricity generation grid, which will eventually be able to cover the demand of the residential buildings once they have reduced their consumption. With this system, we are able to convert the basic energy needs into a right. A part of it will be covered, and if it is exceeded, it will cost more money and will serve to pay for the system. On the other hand, the renovation of buildings also helps us to deal with the risk of energy poverty.

                    We used the certifications and the surface area of the buildings as basic sources of information in the development of the database. In order to facilitate community engagement and provide citizens with the information they need, the u-power platform will be the main stage of interaction between communities and stakeholders. The platform will provide citizens with four main datasets and services: Energy Savings, Participation, Energy Consumption and the Energy Market.

                    In order to co-create a common and collaborative space, it is fundamental to manage the participation of the private communities as well as the communication with the public administration and the different stakeholders. To ensure continuous upgrading and maintenance of all building elements, e-contracts are put into place. We bring all the necessary stakeholders onto the platform in order to facilitate the different processes which are needed over time. The renovation activity is based on the lifespan of the different building layers. Through this process, we want to allow the design of new specific and dynamic policies in relation to each community’s current necessities. Also, it is a common space to improve the local “built environment”.

                    Through the platform, individuals will be able to track their energy consumption in real time. This will provide for better management of the energy credits of each resident. Citizens will be able to see the days in which their consumption was higher than the optimal limit and subsequently modify their behavior to improve that. If individuals don’t spend their entire energy credit within a given month, they can transfer this to another month or sell their credit on the Energy Market.

                    If the entire catalog of renovation solutions is applied, Barcelona will need to produce 50% less energy for its residential buildings and will be able to earn almost €18 million each year from the sale of CO2 credits in order to keep working hand in hand with its citizens to defend their pre-existing and emerging rights.
